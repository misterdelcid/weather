Weather - A Minimalistist Weather App

Description: Weather is a minimalist weather app that allows you to quickly and cleanly view the weather in a given city. The backgrounds dynamically change based of the weather of the searched city. This app was created with React, Styled-Components, Axios, and OpenWeatherMap's API. 

You can check out a demo of the app here: https://misterdelcid.github.io/weather/
